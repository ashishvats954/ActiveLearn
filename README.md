# ActiveLearn: An Intelligent Study Assistant

This is a project for the [Name of Hackathon].

## 1. Problem Statement

[cite_start]Students face challenges in passively consuming video lectures, leading to poor knowledge retention and an interrupted learning flow. [cite: 2, 3, 4] [cite_start]There is no immediate way to evaluate comprehension [cite: 5][cite_start], and finding practice materials afterward is time-consuming. [cite: 7]
